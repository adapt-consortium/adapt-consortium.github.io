If you donât feel like youâre ready enough for MIA, you can apply for MIAâs preparatory effort instead.;MIA works on the basis of Supported Employment (SE) and Case Management (CM). This means that each participant receives the support of a SE supervisor to find, get and keep a job.;The SE supervisor makes a survey to see what kind of work you are interested in. If it turns out during the survey that you need extra support in coordinating contacts or authorities, you can also get the support of a case manager. The Case Manager is available to solve obstacles on the way to work or study with you.;Exactly what efforts each participant receives depends on the needs and wishes. This is the point of MIA.
