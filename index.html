      <p class="font-semibold">ADAPT is an international and interdisciplinary research and development consortium
        exploring and researching the
        potential and real use of machine learning in vocational training. Operating in the intersection of welfare
        coordination and research, ADAPT can facilitate and facilitate tests and processes that not only enable an
        efficient
        implementation of state-of-the-art algorithmic technology in welfare services, but also safeguard democratic and
        ethical principles that should be intrinsic when working with and for human beings.</p>

      <p>Machine learning has been recognized as an increasingly important tool in welfare services. For vocational
        training, this might mean providing new opportunities for learners to acquire practical skills and knowledge,
        creating new systems of recommendations and counseling, as well as bringing new statistical insights. However,
        this
        novel use of data also presents several risks that must be carefully considered, be it bias algorithms, bad
        quality
        data or low data-literacy within the organization.</p>

      <p>The ADAPT consortium is committed to helping welfare organizations make the best possible use of AI in
        vocational
        training while at the same time mitigating organizational, social, and political pitfalls and risks. ADAPT
        combines
        a hands-on applied approach, close collaboration with social welfare providers and clients, and advanced
        expertise
        in computer science and information technology. This enables the consortium to facilitate data-oriented
        projects,
        tests and designs at small and large scale while simultaneously adding a critical perspective in order to
        safeguard
        the rights of users and citizens, as well as general democratic principles.</p>

      <p>The ADAPT consortium consists of:
      <ul>
        <li>SCÖ - Samordningsförbundet Centrala Östergötland (Sweden)</li>
        <li>Stirling University (Scotland)</li>
        <li>Janus Rehabilitation (Iceland)</li>
        <li>CTF - Service Research Center (Sweden)</li>
        <li>Linköping University (Sweden)</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>ADAPT has worked together as a consortium since 2019 in projects funded by actors such as the European Social
        Fund
        (ESF) and VINNOVA (Sweden). As a research and development collaboration, ADAPT offers expertise in AI technology
        and
        implementation, data-literacy workshops and testing and prototyping of data-driven systems in both research
        projects
        and organizational development.</p>
